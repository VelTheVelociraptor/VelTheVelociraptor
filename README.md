Here's some general info incase you want to know more about me !!!

• I'm a man of many fandoms, you can find most of them in my linked carrd !

• I have social anxiety that I'm working though and am neurodivergent so sometimes I won't be up for interacting tons if i've not pre-prepared myself for social interaction beforehand or am not in the mood, but it's not anything personal!

• Please don't make weird/sexual jokes towards me, it can make me a little uncomfortable and I am in a relationship ^^; (Stuff like "I'm gonna tickle you!" is fine as long as we were previously interacting and it's said with innocent intentions)

• I do not knowingly add anyone 14 or younger or 20 and older so please do not request to add me if you are not 15-19 !
